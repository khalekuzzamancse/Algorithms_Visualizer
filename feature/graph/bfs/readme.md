## Next TODO Insha-allah
- Refactor the Pseudocode means rewrite
- Show which unvisited nodes are pushed in the queue,for which parent
- 



- Graph viewer should able to highlight a node(by id) 
- Graph viewer should able to highlight a edge(by id)
- Graph viewer should clear all the node color
- Graph viewer should able to blink a node by id
- Using these feature ,create an interface and a separate graph viewer module
- 
- Take the Input Graph keep the info for drawing node and edges(not editable)
- Made a Traversable graph by forming AdjacentList

What need form Graph Editor
- The info of coordinate

## Observer vs Iterator
- Since we are pulling state upon clicking the next button that is why do not need to observe that state,it is redance,
- It is enough to pull the recent state from the iterator

## BFS Simulation
On Next return the state where the state
- Currently dequeued node(that are processing) ,to highlight it
- 

## Pseudocode Execution
- The Current processing Node (dequeue)
- The Queue
