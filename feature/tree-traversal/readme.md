## Prime's Algorithms
A we talk about link , we do not have the notion of path here
MST=That connect all vertices and it has minimum sum of weights
MST=All edge cost sum is minimum
So we have to remove some edges or selected some
- Pick the  neighbor that has minimum weight edge
- From any node the algorithm can be started ,regardless of of starting node it will end up always the same MST
- It is very similar to Dijkstra
- This graph must has edge cost but not have the node distance
- What are the possible state that will change?
- Graph is undirected
* - Edge cost/weight  is fixed
* - All nodes are fixed

Simulation state:
Current processing node
Current processing edge
